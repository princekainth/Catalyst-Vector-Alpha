## 🏛️ Commercial Architecture

This repository serves as the reference implementation for **Empire Bridge Media Inc.**'s proprietary AI architecture:

| Protocol Layer | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interface** | **Gemini™ Protocol** | Orchestration, API Gateway, and Agent Spawning. |
| **Cognition** | **Meta™ Intelligence** | Swarm consensus, tool synthesis, and reflection. |
| **Infrastructure** | **Microsoft™ Kernel** | Edge-compatible deployment and K8s integration. |

## 📊 Enhanced Dashboard

The Catalyst Vector Alpha now includes a **modern React-based dashboard** with comprehensive monitoring capabilities:

- **Real-time System Health**: Live health scoring and status monitoring
- **Agent Management**: View and control all agents in the swarm
- **Performance Metrics**: CPU, memory, and agent performance tracking
- **Task Monitoring**: Recent task history and execution status
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Pending approvals interface for critical operations
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices

**Dashboard Features:**
- Dark theme optimized for 24/7 operations
- Comprehensive health scoring (0-100) with recommendations
- Agent role distribution visualization
- Real-time metrics and status updates
- Approval system for Kubernetes operations

**Access the Dashboard:**
```bash
# After starting the system, open:
http://localhost:5000/dashboard
```

**Build the Dashboard:**
```bash
cd dashboard
./build_dashboard.sh
```

## ⚡ Key Capabilities

### 1. Autonomous Remediation (The Hand of God)
CVA does not just monitor; it acts.
* **Auto-Discovery:** Automatically maps Kubernetes clusters upon startup.
* **Chaos Resilience:** Validated against **10 Chaos Scenarios** (Pod Kills, CPU Spikes, OOM).
* **Self-Healing:** Detects  events and triggers stabilization workflows.

### 2. The Agent Swarm
Operates a persistent workforce of specialized digital employees:
* **🛡️ EnterpriseMonitor:** The Sentry (K8s/Audit Logs).
* **🧠 Workflow_Analyzer:** The Architect (Self-building tools).
* **⚙️ Planner:** The Executive (Resource allocation).

### 3. Enterprise Integration
* **API Access:** `POST /api/agents/spawn` for dynamic agent creation.
* **Persistence:** Full state preservation via SQLite and ChromaDB.
* **Audit Trail:** Immutable JSONL logs for every decision made by the swarm.
